It is generally agreed that he taught geometry in Hellenistic Egypt, at Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I, between 305 and 285 B.C. He is credited with the thirteen volumes of Elements, a work that accumulated mathematical knowledge and codified it into a deductive system of proofs. Euclidean geometry was the geometry until the 19th century, when mathematicians began to challenge Euclid's assumptions about parallel lines when considering measurements over very large distances of, say, billions of light years.nAnswers.com nHome PagenBrowsenPersonalizenPrint pagenEmail pagenTranslate pagenWikiAnswers.com nHome PagenBrowsenRecent questionsnAdvanced searchnHelpnSearch unanswered questions...nSearch our", "true": "Take me to the homepage for the Euclid Chemical company.", "predicted": "to of the clidss."}

Familiarizing yourself with the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion could help you save your Pit Bulls life.nThe first mistake many pet owners make is assuming that heat exhaustion will only occur during the hottest summer months, when actually it can occur at anytime of the year. Of course, the higher the temperature is, the more likely your dog is to suffer from an episode of heat exhaustion. Anytime your dog is outside, you should watch him closely for any signs that he is in physical distress.nDogs pant to cool themselves by ridding their body of excess heat. Panting to a dog is like our air conditioner on a hot day. Dogs suffer from heat exhaustion when they cannot get rid of all the extra heat in their bodies fast enough. They will begin to pant faster and harder the more they struggle to regain temperature control. Sometimes they will begin to drool excessively, and may get confused.

This book examines the technical issues of orbital debris in a comprehensive manner useful to the systems engineer, yet it is still thought provoking to the researching graduate student. An appendix has been added to this edition to provide updates and insights on a number of important technical and policy events that have occurred since the original printing of the book, and some areasnrequiring more in-depth coverage have been expanded.

And following proper etiquette is certainly one of those little things. So, yes, by all means send a thank-you note. You should always send thank you notes after every interview \u2014 to each person who interviewed you.nWhile I like to make the thank-you note after the first round of interviews more formal, such as the examples found at Free Sample Job Interview and Career Thank-You Letters, I tend to favor a handwritten note of thanks for second interviews. It won\u2019t help you this time, but I would even suggest bringing the note paper and envelope with you to the interview so that once your interview is complete, you can find a quiet place and write a quick note of thanks and drop it in the mail.nThe content of the note should be short and simple. Thank the interviewer for his or her time and reinforce your rapport and fit; restate your unique selling proposition; and close with a proactive statement about getting to the next step in the process.nYou can find other great information in our article, FAQs About Thank You Letters.nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow-up.nBest Way to Send Post-Interview Thank", "true": "How can I best end a job interview positively?", "predicted": "to I get be ofa interview??"}

Most sports have been recreated with a game, including baseball, association football, American football, boxing, wrestling, cricket, golf, basketball, ice hockey, tennis, bowling, rugby, indoor lacrosse. Some games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as the Madden NFL series), while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as Championship Manager). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as Arch Rivals). This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive, just like real-world sports.

Current geologic activity at Yellowstone has remained relatively constant since earth scientists first started monitoring some 30 years ago. Though another caldera-forming eruption is theoretically possible, it is very unlikely to occur in the next thousand or even 10,000 years. Scientists have also found no indication of an imminent smaller eruption of lava.nQ: How much advance notice would there be of an eruption?nA: The science of forecasting a volcanic eruption has significantly advanced over the past 25 years. Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption. Scientists at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory* (YVO) closely monitor the Yellowstone region for such precursors. They expect that the buildup to larger eruptions would include intense precursory activity (far exceeding background levels) at multiple spots within the Yellowstone volcano.

[DOCUMENTS] [DOC 1] Weatherstripping - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedianWeatherstrippingnFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedian(Redirected from Weather stripping)nJump to: navigation, searchnWeatherstripping is the process of sealing openings such as doors, windows, and trunks from the elements. The goal of weatherstripping is to prevent rain and water from entering by either blocking it outright or by blocking most of it and returning or rerouting it. A secondary goal of weatherstripping is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy with heating and air conditioning.nThe materials used in weatherstripping are thresholds, a piece of material, either a sweep or a J-hook, to match the door to the threshold, and the actual weathstripping itself.nEvery exterior door, or door to an uninsulated room such as an attic, must be weatherstripped as required by code enforcement in various states of U.S. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom weatherstripping at the factory.nWeatherstripping is needed on on all openings between interior and exterior locations. Automobiles have large amounts of weatherstripping. Consider a standard 4 door vehicle: the doors may require 20 feet or more per door depending on the size of the opening. Windows will require upwards of 10 feet. Trunks require large amounts. Automotive weatherstipping has added difficulties that must be considered in the engineering of the parts. For example, the weatherstrip must function equally at keeping rain out when the vehicle is parked as when it is screaming down the autobahn. Automotive weatherstripping must endure extreme temperatures (hot and cold); be resistant to automotive liquids such as oil, gasoline, and particularly windshield washerfluid; and must resist years of full sun exposure.

[DOCUMENTS] [DOC 1] Arthur Frommer Online: Campgrounds on the outskirts of most European cities supply an interesting, inexpensive means of lodgingnComments, opinion and advice from the founder of Frommer's Travel GuidesnMar 21, 2008nCampgrounds on the outskirts of most European cities supply an interesting, inexpensive means of lodgingnIn our increasingly frantic search for ways to visit Europe inexpensively, campgrounds and camping should not be overlooked. Almost completely unknown to most American travelers, campgrounds are found on the outskirts of nearly every major European city; indeed, some European cities have as many as a dozen such camps in their outlying areas. And although they are usually in fairly remote neighborhoods, nearly all are on a bus or subway line that can whisk you downtown -- and there are still other prime camping spots in historic centers as well. Did you know you could camp in Paris along the banks of the Seine River in the Bois de Boulogne park (www.campingparis.fr)? How about a campsite with a view overlooking the domes and bell towers of Florence from a hillside terrace in the Oltrarno district (www.ecvacanze.it/ing/michelangelo_home.asp)? Venice even has a campground by the beach on the island next to the Lido, just a short ferry ride from St. Mark's Square (www.camping-miramare.it). Some campgrounds are operated only in warm weather (roughly Easter through October or early November), but many stay open year-round.The bill at a European campground can be a bit confusing, since you are usually charged an array of small fees -- one for the site, another for each person, yet another for your vehicle -- but the total usually ends up around $17 to $26 for a couple in a tent, up to $40 in the most popular campgrounds in the summer high season.
